Basketball team finalist predictor; Link to dataset is provided as cbb.csv

The Python machine learning project using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn is designed to analyze a database of various basketball teams and make predictions on which teams are likely to reach the finals based on their different properties.

The project aims to explore the data to gain insights into the teams' attributes such as their past performance, player stats, and other characteristics that may impact their chances of success in the tournament. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and logistic regression to build predictive models that can accurately forecast the outcomes of the tournament.

To accomplish this task, the project first preprocesses the data by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing it to ensure consistency and prepare it for analysis. The project then splits the data into training and testing datasets to evaluate the performance of the models.

After creating the models, the project evaluates their accuracy and F1 score to determine which algorithm is most effective. The models' outputs are then presented to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the predictions.

In conclusion, this Python machine learning project is designed to provide a robust analysis of basketball teams' performance and identify which teams are likely to reach the finals based on their various properties. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions on team selection and management.
